Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RPO for a single region outage

____________________________________________________________________

The RTO and RPO times are extremely high in the multi region and multi availability zone implementation. And availability zone or even an entire region could fail and the read replica be promoted to the active database. The recovery time is only minutes. In this implementation, both database instances are running. One is active and can be written to. The other is a read only database. The point though is that both databases are actively running. This is different than a strategy where snapshots are created and can be restored from, where that takes much longer. Per Amazon, the RPO is 0 minutes. The RTO is 1-2 minutes.
